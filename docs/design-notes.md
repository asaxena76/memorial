# Home design
Flowing single page layout with sections:

Hero

Scroll

Gallery section starts with one sentence header (“Photo gallery”) 
and then a quiet mosaic (8–12 images).

Memorial Wall after: quote cards.



## Hero (3–4 B&W landscapes)

Full-width, black & white image strip (3–4 images), but text is not on top.

Under the strip: name + dates + one Hindi caption (large, elegant, centered).
Why it works: feels like a printed remembrance card / editorial spread.
The Hindi line gets the respect (space) it deserves.

1) Hero section (3–4 B&W landscapes) — make it feel intentional, not “carousel-ish”

A subtle layout that adapts well:

Desktop: 4 images in a row, each cropped to the same height (e.g., 220–320px tall), 
with generous margins above/below.

Mobile: same images become a swipeable horizontal strip with scroll-snap (so it feels native and calm).

Image treatment ideas (subtle but powerful):

Slightly lifted blacks (a tiny matte look) + consistent contrast so the set feels unified.

Avoid strong vignettes or heavy overlays.

Hero typography block (below images):

Hindi caption: make it the hero line (bigger than it is today).

Name + dates: slightly smaller than the Hindi caption, with generous spacing.

Optional: one very short English line under Hindi (only if needed).
Two lines big + small
